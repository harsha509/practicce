feat: Implement new search functionality and update UI components

This commit introduces a new search functionality for the application, which allows users to search for items more efficiently using advanced filters and dynamic suggestions. The main objectives for this feature are to improve user experience, reduce search times, and increase the relevance of the search results. Additionally, the UI components for the search bar and filter section have been updated to enhance accessibility and maintain a consistent design with the rest of the application.

**Key Changes:**
- Added a new `SearchService` to handle the backend logic for processing search queries. This service integrates with the existing item database and provides support for advanced filters such as category, date range, and popularity. The service also ensures that only relevant results are returned based on user preferences and search history.
- Updated the `SearchBarComponent` to include real-time suggestions as users type their queries. These suggestions are dynamically fetched from the backend and displayed in a dropdown menu below the search bar. Users can select a suggestion or continue typing to refine their query.
- Integrated a debounce mechanism in the search input to prevent excessive API calls while the user is typing. This improves performance and reduces unnecessary load on the server.
- Implemented a new `FilterComponent` that allows users to apply filters to their search. These filters include sorting by category, date, and popularity, as well as a range selector for price and rating. The filters are designed to be responsive and work seamlessly across different devices.
- Updated the overall layout of the search page to ensure it is mobile-friendly and accessible. This includes making the search input larger, increasing the contrast of text for better readability, and ensuring that all interactive elements are easy to use on both desktop and mobile platforms.
- Refactored the existing search-related code to improve readability and maintainability. This includes breaking down large methods into smaller, more manageable functions and ensuring that all new code is well-documented with clear comments and proper naming conventions.
- Added unit tests for all new services and components. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases where no results are returned, invalid queries, and the application of multiple filters simultaneously.
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new search functionality. This includes updating the user guide with instructions on how to use the new search and filter options, as well as adding details on how developers can integrate or modify the search behavior in the future.

**Why This Change Matters:**
This new search functionality is a significant improvement over the previous version, which was limited in terms of filtering options and performance. The dynamic suggestions and advanced filters give users more control over their search results, making it easier for them to find the items they are looking for. Additionally, the performance optimizations ensure that the search feature scales well as the number of users and items in the database grows.

**Potential Future Improvements:**
- Adding support for voice search or image-based search to provide more search options for users with different preferences or needs.
- Implementing machine learning algorithms to further improve the relevance of search results based on user behavior and preferences over time.
- Expanding the filter options to include more detailed criteria, such as location-based searches or customizable date ranges.
- Adding a search history feature that allows users to quickly access their previous searches or favorite items.

This commit is the first step towards building a more robust search system that will scale with the growing needs of our application and provide users with a more intuitive and efficient way to navigate our content.
